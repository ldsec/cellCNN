To use the CellCnn implementation:
    - download the NK cell dataset at https://imsb.ethz.ch/research/claassen/Software/cellcnn.html,
    - uncompress and place it in the data/cellCNN/ folder
    - generate the normalized input with the jupyter notebook "data/cellCNN/cellCNN_gen_data.ipynb"

eval/
contains the evaluation plots and the notebook used to generate them

layers/
contains the implementation of neural networks layers

protocols/
contains the implementation of the centralized and distributed protocols
    The centralized protocol can be executed with protocols/centralized/centralized_test.go
        (use flag "-run CellCnn" for the full protocol)
    The distributed protocol can be executed with protocols/decentralized/cnn_clear_test.go

simul/
contains the simulation configurations (to use with Mininet)

utils/
contains various utilities files
